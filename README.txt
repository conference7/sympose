Sympose makes it easy for anyone to create a conference website. Install WordPress, install Sympose and kick start your conference. Sympose integrates with all WordPress themes.


== Description ==
Sympose by [Conference7](https://conference7.com) makes it easy to share knowledge in WordPress. The core of this plugin is the schedule. Easily create schedules for events, and link the individual sessions to people (speakers) and organisation (sponsors).

**Ready to start sharing knowledge?**

Check out the demo at [https://demo.conference7.com](https://demo.conference7.com).


**Sympose Quick Start**

After activating Sympose, you can start shaping your event right away! Check out the video below for an example.

=== Shortcodes ===

Below you'll find some Sympose shortcodes. You can also find specific shortcodes for your event in Sympose -> Shortcodes (in the WordPress dashboard)

= Shortcode example for displaying people =

`[sympose type="person" category="speakers" event="sympose" description="false" name="true"]`

This will display people from the category speakers and the event "sympose".

= Shortcode example for displaying a schedule =

`[sympose type="schedule" event="sympose"]`

This will display the schedule for the event "sympose".

= Shortcode example for displaying organisations =

`[sympose type="organisation" category="sponsors" event="sympose"]`

This will display organisations from the category sponsors and the event "sympose".

Check out other shortcodes (after creating posts and categories) in the Sympose -> Shortcodes menu.

== Installation ==

I recommend to install plugins via your WordPress Dashboard. Go to Plugins -> Add new, and search for `Sympose`.
